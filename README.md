<p><b> MOLTINO </b> is a versatile input/output (I/O) module designed for measurement, control, and monitoring in industrial, academic, or development environments.<br>
Is a modular system with documented hardware, including publicly available schematics for reference and firmware development.
While the PCB design remains proprietary to protect original production, users are encouraged to build their own firmware and applications.
The system supports a variety of Arduino Uno form factor controllers, enabling compatibility with widely available microcontroller platforms such as AVR, STM32, ESP32, and RP2040.<br>
<b> MOLTINO </b> aims to strike a balance between openness, collaboration, and commercial sustainability.</p>
<p><lh><u><b>Main features:</b></u></lh>
<ul><li>4 0-10V analog inputs (16bit resolution)
<li>4 multifunction digital inputs
<li>4 0-10V/300mA analog outputs
<li>4 relay outputs
<li>Integrated power supply</li>
<li>Integrated RS485 communication</li>
<li>LCD screen</li>
<li>Modular design</li>
<li>Maximum protection</li></ul></p>
<p><b>Flexible firmware development:</b></p>
<p><b> MOLTINO </b> allows anyone to develop their own firmware tailored to specific needs.
Thanks to its compatibility with standard Arduino Uno form factor boards, developers can easily use a wide range of controllers available on the market — including AVR, STM32, ESP32, and RP2040 — to create powerful and customized solutions.</p>
