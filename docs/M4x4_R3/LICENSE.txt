MOLTINO Precompiled Firmware License Agreement

Version 1.1 — May 2025
© 2025 tmslab. All rights reserved.

This license governs the use of the precompiled firmware ("the Firmware") provided by tmslab for use exclusively with the MOLTINO family of devices. By using, copying, or installing the Firmware, you agree to the terms of this license.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE

You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, and royalty-free license to:

    Use the Firmware only in its original binary form.

    Load and run the Firmware on Arduino-compatible boards (Uno R3, Uno R4) only when used in combination with original MOLTINO hardware manufactured by tmslab.

    Include the Firmware in development workflows solely for the purpose of building user applications compatible with MOLTINO hardware.

    Use the Firmware for educational, personal, academic, or experimental purposes.

    Redistribute the Firmware in its original binary form, only as part of original MOLTINO hardware, and only if this license is included in full and unaltered.

Any use of the Firmware outside these terms constitutes a breach of this license.

2. NON-COMMERCIAL USE

The Firmware may be used free of charge for non-commercial purposes, including:

    Personal, academic, research, educational, or hobbyist projects.

    Open-source firmware development that does not involve resale or monetization of MOLTINO hardware or derivatives.

    Demonstrations, documentation, or technical showcases, as long as the Firmware is not executed on unauthorized hardware.

Commercial use is defined as any activity that:

    Generates direct or indirect revenue,

    Is part of a product or service offered for profit,

    Aims to obtain financial or industrial gain.

3. COMMERCIAL USE

Use of the Firmware in products, services, manufacturing, or commercial systems requires a written agreement with tmslab. This includes but is not limited to:

    Sale of products that include or depend on the Firmware.

    Provision of paid services that use or incorporate the Firmware.

    Inclusion of the Firmware in third-party systems, OEM products, SaaS platforms, or integrated commercial offerings.

However, the resale of original MOLTINO devices manufactured by tmslab, including the preinstalled Firmware, is explicitly allowed, provided that:

    The Firmware remains unmodified,

    It is not extracted or redistributed separately,

    All copyright, trademark, and license notices remain intact.

4. RESTRICTIONS

Under no circumstances may you:

    Modify, decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Firmware.

    Redistribute the Firmware separately or alongside any hardware that is not original MOLTINO.

    Use the Firmware on cloned, altered, or third-party-manufactured hardware.

    Use the Firmware as a base to develop derivative versions, functional replicas, or competing products.

    Remove or alter copyright, trademark, license terms, or any identification belonging to tmslab.

5. OWNERSHIP

The Firmware is a copyrighted and proprietary work. All rights not explicitly granted in this agreement are reserved by tmslab. This license does not transfer any rights to the source code nor any ownership of the Firmware or any part thereof.

6. NO WARRANTY

The Firmware is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind. tmslab makes no guarantees regarding its performance, suitability, stability, or compatibility. You assume all risk associated with its use.

7. TERMINATION

This license will terminate automatically if you violate any of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use and destroy all copies of the Firmware in your possession. Termination does not limit tmslab’s right to seek damages or other legal remedies.

8. GOVERNING LAW

This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the country in which tmslab is legally registered, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
